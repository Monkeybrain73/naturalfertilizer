🌱 **Natural Fertilizer** (Vintage Story Mod)

Natural Fertilizer introduces a simple but immersive manure system to Vintage Story.
Animals now periodically defecate, leaving droppings in the world that can be collected and processed into fertilizer.


**Features & Mechanics**

🐄 **Animal Manure:** Domesticated animals naturally produce dung over time, when fed.

💩 **Dung Piles:** Droppings accumulate in stages and can be combined into larger piles.

🌾 **Fertilizer Use:** Manure piles can be composted directly on the ground, or in barrels, to produce fertilizer that can improve farmland soil for better fertility.

🛑 **Smart Placement:** The system avoids overwriting important blocks like chicken eggs, nests, or other droppings.

🔄 **Configurable Rules:** Forbidden overwrite targets are configurable via JSON for modpack balance.

🏡 **Immersive Gameplay:** Droppings appear naturally in barns, pastures and pens, encouraging players to manage livestock waste as a resource.



**What this mod currently changes/adds:**

  Animals fed from troughs or food thrown on the ground, will produce droppings after a random time.
  Manure can be processed into fertilizer in two immersive methods: ground piles or fermented in a barrel.
  Fertilizers can be used on tilled farmland, just like any other fertilizer in the game.
 

**Compatibility:**
  None at the moment.
 

**Roadmap:**
  Compatibility with various creature mods.
  Add more configuration options to easier adapt use and compatibility.
  Manure piles left on the ground for long periods of time, without mixing with grass to start fermentation, will transit to a low value fertilizer.
  Weather effects processing time for open air compost piles.
  Flies buzz over piles of manure and storage that contain manure
